    <p>Hi. My Name is Selin. I have been learning software development for 3 years. Before I had worked in different
        sectors.
    </p>
    <p>I started learning programming with HTML and CSS. Then I moved on to back-end like C#, databases etc. At last, I
        continued with mobile app development with Flutter.</p>
    <p>What motivates me about coming back to HTML is Angela Yu. I really liked her teaching in her Flutter course and
        looked at other tutorials of her. And I encountered to Web Development Course. Nowadays I am studying both
        Flutter and Web Development.</p>
    <p>
        Finally, I want to note that this portfolio is a beginning of our Web Development Course. Day by day I will
        develop and beautify this portfolio page.
